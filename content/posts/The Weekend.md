## Working Over the Weekend
I worked over the weekend attempting to get my `learning-log` python application deployed. I was unsuccessful in doing so. However, I learned so much in my attempt.

I streamlined my workflow from using bash scripts and `scp` to using Ansible. In writing the Ansible playbook, I gained deeper understanding of how to write playbooks and appreciated even more the ease Ansible provides.

In searching for solutions to my deployment, I gained knowledge in how Kubernetes works. Also, it really clicked what containerization and container orchestration provides in terms of managing infrastructure. Before this weekend it was an abstract idea. After this weekend, the idea has crystallized.

I am going to continue to get this application deployed.
